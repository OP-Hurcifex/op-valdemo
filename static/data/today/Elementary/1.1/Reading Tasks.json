She woke up early and took a train to the city with her friend Anna.</p>\n<p>First, they visited a big museum. Lisa enjoyed the paintings, but Anna liked the old statues more. After the museum, they were hungry, so they ate lunch in a small café. Lisa had pasta, and Anna chose pizza.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, they went shopping. Lisa bought a new jacket because it was on sale, and Anna bought a pair of shoes. They also took many photos together.</p>\n<p>In the evening, they returned home tired but happy.
